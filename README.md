# Independent Study Option

As part of my MSc course, I'm currently working on a project related to increasing variety in artificial texts. This focuses on an indepth study of variational sequence to sequence models, and an implementation of the [Variational Autoregressive Decoder by Du et al](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/media/publications/Variational_Autoregressive__Decoder_for_Neural_Response_Generation_Proceedings-lidong(oral).pdf). Various models were subject to various datasets to determine variability of the conditional sequences generated.

A copy of the report can be found [here](Documents/report.pdf), and similarly so for the [presentation](Documents/presentation.pdf).
